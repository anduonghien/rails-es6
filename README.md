# Rails 5 with ES6

- Using [Sprockets::Commoner](https://github.com/Shopify/sprockets-commoner) we can easily set up ES6 using Babel transformations in Sprockets.
- This allows us the use npm packages without the need for Browserify or Webpack.
- Follow the [commit history](https://github.com/tomsabin/rails-es6/commits/master) for set up. Clone and run locally to see it in action yourself.
